# text_me_crypto

text me crypto is essentially a fork of my original textmebitcoin script that is also here in my github profile. i initially made that because i invested only in bitcoin. since then i have invested in ethereum as well and wanted to include that in my code too. the downside is it wasnt as easy as adding a few variables, i had to completely rearrange my code, so i saw it fit to creat a new repository.

An example text message you would receive would look like:
"BTC 30,000, bitcoin wallet value is at 500.00
 ETH 1000, ethereum wallet value is at 200.00"
 
Output is conditional on what you enter into your environmental variables. (assumingly what you invest in each cryptocurrency). this can be further modified as more cryptocurrencies are invested in with some simple copy and paste and renaming global variables, and adding one or multiple new "message_to_send" local variables within the txt_code function in the body local variable.
